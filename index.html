                    Well, before I tell you. Let me take you back in time...
                </p>
                <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest text-lg">
                    Remember when you're in secondary school. Teachers will ask you to write a letter or essay as a classwork, assignment or even during test? What about the interesting storybooks you used to borrow from your friend to read?
                </p>
                <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest text-lg">
                    How do you always feel? Well, for me, I always feel intrigued 'cos putting something on paper using my pen has always been my passion. 
Those times, writing and reading stories make you excited. To make people smile and imagine wonderful things in their head with your stories is always a good feeling.
                </p>

                    Now, talents are being wasted, passions are becoming useless, inks are getting dried. Why?

                <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest text-lg">
                    Tell me, why would I think of writing when I don't know where my next meal will come from?
                </p>
                <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest text-lg">
                    As a result, many writers are underappreciated which left them frustrated. Some even quit writing.

                    As you're thinking about this. Let me <span class="italic">burst your head</span>. Do you know some writers are lowkey-ly earning lots of money (infact in dollars) just by writing <u>Simple Stories</u> like those secondary school times? I bet you didn't!
                </p>
                <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest text-lg">
                    Now, you don't have to be writing in vain when they are lots of people waiting in their thousands to consume your stories. I mean...
People are now willing to pay for your <b>handcraft</b> more than ever.

                    Well, that's what I'm on a mission to let you discover it by yourself through this 11-Day Writing Challenge. 
                </p>
                <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest"> Each day, I will give you action steps you must take sequentially tailored to your personal needs or expectations. As long as you follow instructions and implement these steps without missing a day, you will surely see results. That's guaranteed.

                <p class="p-5 text-xl leading tracking-wider  pop-font font-bold">Why Do I Need to Hop On This Challenge?</p> 
                    <p
                    class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest font-medium counter-number">
                    That's pretty simple. Writing is a vast niche and a highly profitable one. As big as it is, It can be frustrating and discouraging esp. for newbies who want to get in but don't know where to start from. Or if you've been writing for a very long time without little or no result to show for it. Then You need to know the NEW WAY of Writing. You might also want to upgrade your writing capacity to the next level (The level companies will be paying you thousands of dollars to publish your work instead of you paying them). </p>
                    <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest">This is why the challenge is very important if you're in one of this vehicle. Joining this challenge is like getting a mentor or an accountability partner.</p>
